# Introduction

## Getting started

This tutorial is an introduction to mass spectrometry data handling and preprocessing in Python, and also an introduction to some machine learning algorithms.
As with a previous tutorial in this summer school, we will rely on the scikit-learn and numpy packages to handle, respectively, the machine learning and matrices of data.
