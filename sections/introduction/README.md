# Introduction

## Getting started

This tutorial is an introduction to mass spectrometry data handling and preprocessing in Python, and also an introduction to some machine learning algorithms.
As with a previous tutorial in this summer school, we will rely on the scikit-learn and numpy packages to handle, respectively, the machine learning and matrices of data.

Please ensure you run the install script in order for some sections of code to work.
This will simply compile some c++ code that will be used for the alignment algorithm.

```bash
sh install.sh
```

Then, enter the example directory

```bash
cd example/
```

And open a jupyter notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you should have acquired the following skills:
* Using Python to apply correction algorithms to mass spectra data sets.
* Perform machine learning experiments using correct protocols.
* Applying learning algorithms to mass spectra data
