# Applying Virtual Lock Masses and Alignment

## Loading the spectra

*spectra are stored in lcs(hdf5?) format*

*loaded in memory through a snippet*

```python
code snippet
```

*at this moment, spectra are largely unprocessed and not ready for meaningful comparisons*

## Applying the Virtual Lock Mass Algorithm

*summarize correction problem*

*show example figure*

*the virtual lock mass algorithm must be applied to the dataset*

```python
code snippet
```

*explain commands*

## Applying Alignment

*VLM peaks are already aligned, but some variation remains on other peaks*

*fig?*

*an alignment algorithm must be applied to the data to render spectra more comparable*

```python
code snippet
```

*Intensity normalisations can be introduced at this point*

*The data is ready to be converted into a format appropriate for machine learning*
